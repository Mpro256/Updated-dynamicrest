this lets your slayer bot on binmaster easily take breaks, nothing else, read the python file for any fields that need to be changed

# installation:
1. download python 3.12 (make sure to check `add python.exe to path`)
2. clone or download the repo
3. open main.py in any text editor to see all fields that need to be changed (at the top)
4. open cmd and enter `py main.py`


(also you can open issues to suggest features)
